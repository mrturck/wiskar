### <b>Inspiration</b><br>
Imagine a world where there is no need for physical computers or hardware. Everything you're used to seeing on your laptop can be seen
virtually, hovering in front of you. You can check the weather, catch up on email, or sift through
recommended articles all from the comfort of your bed. All you need are a pair of smart glasses and an internet connection. Of course this code
is not about the smart glasses, but the software that these glasses will run. This code is to provide a path to a world where web sites can be created
in the augmented world.
